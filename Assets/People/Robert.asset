  condemnReaction: Yes, whatever. Bernard is also dead and that is all that matters
    to me.
  rewardReaction: Are you new at this job? Ok this is a surprise. Err, than you?
  defaultText: I can't believe what I just had to do to keep that fiend Antonio quiet.
    All for nothing, now we are all corpses, what good did that do?
  personDefaultText: An angry looking man paces the room back and forth shaking his
    head.
  lastWords: Bernard ruined my family, he deserved to die. Yes, I stole the evidence
    that would have spared him. Sue me.
  condemnedMessage: Robert has been reincarnated as a cat owned by a teenage girl.
    He constantly harassed into performing funny feats for her "Funny cats" Youtube
    channel.
  rewardMessage: White sand, clear waters, the sound of waves, a cocktail with an
    umbrella and a private butler. Robert is living the life. A life that he totally
    does not deserve. Maybe this was a mistake?
