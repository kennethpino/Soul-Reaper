  condemnReaction: Are you serious? It was only this once and just to piss Robert
    off! Noooooo!
  commendReaction: Phew, for a second there I thought I was doing down where that
    bastard Robert is, it serves him well.
  defaultText: Who What Wait! Listen, don't think anything of what I just did. It
    was Robert who hid that evidence I only want it to punish him for it.
  lastWords: I know that bribing Robert into sexual favors was wrong, I am sorry.
    But what he did condemened a man to death. That IS wrong.

    demons as per your request. That will teach him to force other people down their
    knees.
  commendedMessage: 'Antonio is living in a harem surrounded by beatiful men who
    please him and serve him at will.
