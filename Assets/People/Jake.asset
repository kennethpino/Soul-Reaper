  condemnReaction: No! This must be a mistake! I am only 16 I have done nothing wrong!
    Please!
  rewardReaction: Thank you. I hope somehow I will get to continue enjoying my teenage
    years. Hopefully without my annoying parents hovering day and night.
  defaultText: What... what happened? Am I dead? I remember a bright light and a
    shock wave bursting through my chest.
  personDefaultText: A boy stares at himself in the mirror as he tries to process
    this predicament.
  lastWords: No. Have you seen my parents? They must be super worried. IS this going
    to hurt?
  condemnedMessage: Out of all the possible evils, Jake is currently stuck in what
    it seems to be a toilet replica where he checked out (smell inclusive).
  rewardMessage: There is no worrying anymore about those parking tickets and indicent
    exposure reports. Jake is now living in a world of frat parties, after hours
    and daily random sex with the hottest babes. Hopefully his parents get stuck
    on traffic.
