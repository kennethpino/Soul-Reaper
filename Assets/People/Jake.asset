  condemnReaction: No. No! this must be a mistake! I am only 16 I have done nothing
    wrong! Please!
  commendReaction: Thank you. Hopefully I will find my parents and we can be a family
    in the after life.
  defaultText: What. What happened? Am I dead? I remember a bright light and a wave
    going through my chest.
  lastWords: No. Have you seen my parents? They must be super worried. Will it hurt?
  condemnedMessage: Out of all the possible evils, Jake is currently stuck in what
    it seems to be a toilet replica where he checked out (smell inclusive), while
    he waits for his loving parents to come to his rescue.
  commendedMessage: There is no worrying anymore about those parking tickets and
    public exposure. Jake is now living in a world of frat parties, after hours and
    daily random sex with the hottest babes. Hopefully his parents get stuck on traffick.
